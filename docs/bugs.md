### killing the invaders
- weird edge case where we cant kill the top left corner invader

### invaders
- the game doesnt pause at all
- game seems to keep going in the background after changing settings?
    - maybe try to reset it?
    - this also messes w scoreboard results, as the num rounds keeps increasing
