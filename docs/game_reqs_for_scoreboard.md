# Game Requirements for Scoreboard
- 1. need to implement GameSettings making some gameSettings for your game
    - need a starting score, if you dont pass one the default will be 1
    - if its possible to get below 1 in your scores then you must change this
    - see SlidingTileSettings for an example
- 2. you'll need to call addScoreToScoreboard every time someone wins your game
    - this is a static method
    - just need to pass the username, a class inherited from GameSettings, and the new score
    - see BoardManager as an example (the last 3 functions)
- 3. you'll need to pass the app compat activity all the way down from your activity to where your trying to save the scoreboard
    - see on create in GameActivity as an example
        - just the one line in onCreate
